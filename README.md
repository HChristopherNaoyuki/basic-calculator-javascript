- **CSS**: The styles provide a modern look, including:
  - Flexbox for centering and organizing the layout.
  - Grid for the calculator buttons.
  - Transitions for smooth theme changes and button interactions.

- **JavaScript**: 
  - The `toggleThemeBtn` toggles between dark and light themes when clicked.
  - Each button has an event listener that updates the display or performs a calculation when clicked.
  - The `eval()` function is used for calculating the result when the "=" button is pressed. Basic error handling ensures the app doesnâ€™t crash on invalid input.
